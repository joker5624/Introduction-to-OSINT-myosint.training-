Micah and Griffin discuss how, in general, OSINT investigations are conducted. This process is presented so that you and your organization can start thinking about some of the steps you might need to work through in your work. Due to the huge variety in OSINT work and organizations in the world, we suggest that the material presented in this lesson be used as a framework to build on and not a process to use as presented.

Topics in this lesson include:

  -The differences between data, information, and intelligence
  -A walk-through of an OSINT investigation process
  -Discussions about the different types of tools OSINT investigators use
  -What "pivoting" is and why it is important
  -Generating reports and output for your customer
  -Thinking about how your customer is going to consume your output and making it as accessible as possible
